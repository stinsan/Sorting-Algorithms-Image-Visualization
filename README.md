## Getting Started :heavy_check_mark:
### Prerequisites
This program uses the following Python modules:

- Pillow
```
pip install Pillow
```

- NumPy
```
pip install numpy
```

- OpenCV
```
pip install opencv
```

- The H264 video codec must also be installed becuase OpenCV does not include
it in the default installation. <br/>
After downloading, unzip the file, then place the .dll file in the same directory as main.py. <br/>
Download the latest release from here: https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases

### Installation
All there is to do is clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/stinsan/Sorting-Randomized-Images.git
```

## Running the Program :runner:
The program is invoked by the following command:
```
python main.py <sorting_algorithm>
```

The <sorting_algorithm> parameter can be one of the following:

| Parameter Name | Sorting Algorithm Used|
|----------------|-------------------|
|bubble|Bubblesort|
|insert|Insertion Sort|
|select|Selection Sort|
|merge|Merge Sort|
|quick|Quicksort|
|heap|Heapsort|
|count|Counting Sort|g
|radix|Radix Sort|
|bucket|Bucket Sort|
