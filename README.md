## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This program uses the following Python modules:

- Pillow
```
pip install Pillow
```

- NumPy
```
pip install numpy
```

- OpenCV
```

The H264 video codec must also be installed becuase OpenCV does not include
it in the default installation. <br/>
Place the .dll file in the same directory as main.py. <br/>
